# Dumfries and Galloway Place-Name Wordle (D&G-le)

This is a Dumfries and Galloway place-name version of Wordle, based on the [React-Wordle](https://github.com/cwackerfuss/react-wordle) clone.

There are 132 place-names to chose from. (English words and place-names outwith D&G are accepted as guesses.) The names are taken from the 2nd edition 6-inch Ordnance Survey, via the [GB1900 Gazetteer](https://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/data/).

Never heard of the place? Type the answer into the [National Library of Scotland's GB1900 viewer](https://geo.nls.uk/maps/gb1900/#zoom=6&lat=55.0000&lon=-2.5000&layer=0) to see it on the map.
